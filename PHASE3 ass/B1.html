    <p>The Solar System[c] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.[4] The largest
        of these objects are the eight planets, which in order from the Sun are four terrestrial planets (Mercury,
        Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar
        System developed 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a
        protoplanetary disc.

        All four terrestrial planets belong to the inner Solar System and have solid surfaces. Inversely, all four giant
        planets belong to the outer Solar System and do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of
        gases and liquids. 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass are in
        Jupiter and Saturn. There is a strong consensus among astronomers that the Solar System has eight dwarf planets,
        which consist of one asteroid-belt object – Ceres; four Kuiper-belt objects – Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, and
        Makemake; and three scattered-disc objects – Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna.</p>
