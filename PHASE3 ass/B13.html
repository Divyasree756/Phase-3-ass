                At its 20 centers and facilities across the country – and the only National Laboratory in space – NASA
                studies Earth, including its climate, our Sun, and our solar system and beyond. We conduct research,
                testing, and development to advance aeronautics, including electric propulsion and supersonic flight. We
                develop and fund space technologies that will enable future exploration and benefit life on Earth.
                NASA stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA is a U.S. government agency that is
                responsible for science and technology related to air and space. The Space Age started in 1957 with the
