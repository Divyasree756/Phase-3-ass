            <center><h1>MUSICAL CONCERT</h1></center>
            <p>A concert is a live music performance in front of an audience.[1] The performance may be carried by a single
                musician, sometimes then called a recital, or by a musical ensemble, such as an orchestra, choir, or band.
                Concerts are held in a wide variety and size of settings, from private houses and small nightclubs,
                dedicated concert halls, amphitheatres and parks, to large multipurpose buildings, such as arenas and
                stadiums. Indoor concerts held in the largest venues are sometimes called arena concerts or amphitheatre
                concerts. Informal names for a concert include show and gig.
    
                Regardless of the venue, musicians usually perform on a stage (if not actual then an area of the floor
                designated as such). Concerts often require live event support with professional audio equipment. Before
                recorded music, concerts provided the main opportunity to hear musicians play. For large concerts or concert
                tours, the challenging logistics of arranging the musicians, venue, equipment and audience (ticket sales)
                are handled by professional tour promoters.</p>
