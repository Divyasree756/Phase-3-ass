        <p>An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual or multiple
            individuals to hold public office.

            Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th
            century.[1] Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for
            regional and local government. This process is also used in many other private and business organisations,
            from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations.</p>

                    <p>If the document is not too large to attach to an email message, send me a copy of it that way,
                        referencing this thread in the covering email message and I will see if I can recover your
                        document.

                        Alternatively, upload a copy of the document to the following folder of my OneDrive

                        https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmuIXmFDy-1a8nP3RpgnYHp-5zXK

                        and send me an email to the address shown in my signature to let me know that it is there.

                        When I find out what type of corruption is in the document, I will try and make suggestions of
                        how to prevent it from re-occuring</p>
