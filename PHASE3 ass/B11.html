        <p>Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn how to do things and
            support them to think about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach ways to find and
            use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it better.
            Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to
            generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and
            effective citizen.
            Education may help and guide individuals from one class to another. Educated people and groups can do things
            like help less-educated people and encourage them to get educated
            Education encompasses teaching and learning specific skills, and also something less tangible but more
            profound: the imparting of knowledge, positive judgment and well-developed wisdom. Education has as one of
            its fundamental aspects the imparting of culture from generation to generation (see socialization), yet it
            more refers to the formal process of teaching and learning found in the school environment.

            Education means "to draw out," facilitating the realization of self-potential and latent talents of an
            individual. It is an application of pedagogy, a body of theoretical and applied research relating to
            teaching and learning and draws on many disciplines such as psychology, philosophy, computer science,
            linguistics, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology.</p>

            The Ministry of Education (MoE) is a ministry of the Government of India, responsible for the implementation
            of the National Policy on Education.[1] The ministry is further divided into two departments: the Department
            of School Education and Literacy, which deals with primary, secondary and higher secondary education, adult
            education and literacy, and the Department of Higher Education, which deals with university level education,
            technical education, scholarships, etc.

            The current education minister is Dharmendra Pradhan, a member of the Council of Ministers.[2] India had a
            Ministry of Education since 1947. In 1985, the Rajiv Gandhi government changed its name to the Ministry of
            Human Resource Development (MHRD), and with the public announcement of the newly drafted "National Education
            Policy 2020" by the Narendra Modi government, the Ministry of Human Resource Development was renamed back to
            the Ministry of Education.[3]
